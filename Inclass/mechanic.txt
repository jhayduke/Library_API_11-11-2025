Design an ERD for a smallmechanic shop that includes entities like customers, service_tickets, and mechanics.

Think about the information that should be stored in each table.
When you last went to a mechanic what information did they collect from you?
What do you think is important information to document about a service? Maybe a description? You'd probably need the cars VIN?
For mechanics maybe keep this one simple. For most companies there is a variety of information stored about each employee, for this simple project lets keep the employee info basic: name, email, address, phone, salary etc.

Lastly, think about the relationships these entities have.
As a customer how many times can I bring my car to the shop?
How many customers should a single service be attributed to?
Could a single service require multiple mechanics?
As a mechanic would I be responsible for multiple services throughout the day?



customers - 
    -ID INT PK, first_name VC, last_name VC, Address VC, Phone INT, email VC


service_tickets,
    -ID INT PK, date_of_service DATE, amount_quoted INT, amount_charged INT, mechanic_assigned VC



Mechanics - 
    -ID INT PK, first_name VC, last_name VC, email VC, phone VC, salary INT


Car - 
    -ID INT PK, year INT, make VC, model VC, color VC, Specialization VC, VIN VC, notes text



Relationships:
customer -> service_tickets: 1:M One customer can receive many services, once service_ticket will link back to a single customer
service_tickets -> mechanics: M:M 1 ticket could require many mechanics, 1 mechanic will work on many tickets
